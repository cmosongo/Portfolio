# üìä Financial Data Analysis & Machine Learning Portfolio

## ü§µ About Me

I'm passionate about applying data science and machine learning to solve real-world problems across finance, healthcare, and entertainment industries. My work focuses on:

- **Fraud Detection & Risk Management** in financial services
- **Recommendation Systems** for improved user engagement
- **Time-Series Analysis** and pattern recognition
- **Deep Learning Applications** in financial markets

I believe in combining traditional quantitative analysis with modern machine learning techniques to create robust, practical solutions.
